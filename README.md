HyperSkill Study

Welcome to my HyperSkill directory. Here you can find Hyperskill projects I have completed and started.
Below is a short description of the structure of this Git repository.

# Completed projects:

## Set_2/PJ_2_Zookeeper.py
_Simple test project._

## Set_3/PJ_3_Simple_Chatty_Bot.py 
_Create a simple console chatbot from scratch that will communicate with you and perform basic arithmetic operations._

## Set_4/PJ_4_Generating_Randomness.py
_Everyone knows that people are bad at generating random things. In this project, we will check this assumption using a small self-written program that will predict "random" user actions. We'll see if you can beat it!_

## Set_5/PJ_5_HR_Data_Analysis.py
_You work as an analyst in a company. The company's HR boss provided you with three datasets. The first two contain information about employees' performance in offices A and B: how much they work, their salaries, the number of their projects, departments, and so on. The third one is an extensive dataset with information on the employees' satisfaction with their jobs, their latest evaluation metrics, and the current status in the company. Your task is to analyze the data and answer some of the HR’s questions._

## Set_6/PJ_6_Data_Analysis_for_Hospitals.py
_You know the story. Data is everywhere: texts, images, news, and spreadsheets. It affects our habits and defines our future. The amount of data is growing by the second. How can one stay afloat in this great sea of data? Data analysis is required in any line of business. In this project, you will conduct a comprehensive study with pandas. You will upload datasets, deal with data omissions and incorrect data filling, find the main statistical characteristics, and visualize your data. Let's do it!_

## Set_7/PJ_7_Salary_Prediction.py
_Linear regression is one of the simplest yet powerful tools for finding regularities in data and using them for prediction. It is widely applied both in science and practice. In this project, you will learn how to apply scikit-learn library to fit linear models, use them for prediction, compare the models, and select the best one. You will also learn how to carry out testing for certain issues with data._

## Set_8/PJ_8_Neural_Network_from_Scratch.py
_Let's train a very simple but fully connected neural network! In this project, we'll create the necessary metric functions and use custom feedforward and backpropagation methods and functions, all done by hand. The dataset for this project is Fashion-MNIST – no more boring number recognition._
